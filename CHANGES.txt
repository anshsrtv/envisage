Envisage CHANGELOG
==================

What's new in Envisage 4.5.0
----------------------------

- IPythonKernelPlugin for Tasks: run an IPython kernel within the envisage app
  and expose it as a service.


Release 4.4.0
-------------

The major component of this feature is to work with the new
``traits.adaptation`` mechanism in place of the deprecated
``traits.protocols``, maintaining compatibility with ``traits`` version
4.4.0.

This release also adds a new method to retrieve a service that is
required by the application and provides documentation and test updates.
